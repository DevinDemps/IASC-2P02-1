And I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone with both his hands. With hands and feet he
tried to roll it up to the top of the hill, but always, just before
he could roll it over on to the other side, its weight would be
too much for him, and the pitiless stone {98} would come
thundering down again on to the plain. Then he would begin trying to push it up hill again, and the sweat ran off him
and the steam rose after him.
